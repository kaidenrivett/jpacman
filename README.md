# JPacman


## About

Pacman-like game used for teaching software testing.
It exposes students to the use of git, Gradle, JUnit, and mockito.

Parts of the code are well tested, whereas others are left untested intentionally. As a student in software testing, you can extend the test suite, or use the codebase to build extensions in a test-driven way. As a teacher, you can use JPacman to create your own testing exercises.

## Getting Started

### IntelliJ
1. Git clone the project
2. Open IntelliJ and create new project "from existing sources"
3. Select 'Gradle' in the following screen as external model, and click 'Next'
4. In the next screen, optionally adjust the Gradle options and click 'Finish'
5. To see JPacman in action: run `Launcher`
5. To run the test suite in IntelliJ: right click on a test or directory -> `Run` or `Run ...Test`

### Command line
1. Git clone the project
2. To see JPacman in action: `./gradlew run`
3. To run the test suite and static analysis tools: `./gradlew check`
    1. For tests only run `./gradlew test`
    2. For static analysis tools only run `./gradlew staticAnalysis`
	 
ANSWERS

Exercise 3: Why canâ€™t we exhaustively test our entire software project? What should we do instead?

We are unable to exhaustively test our entire software project due to the fact that it could in some
cases take millions of years. If a software system has just 100 flags, that's a whopping 1+e30 
combinations that need to be tested. Instead of this, we can note that bugs aren't
uniformly distributed, and that a majority of the bugs in a system are located in one area.
By having a wide variation of testing in these places in the code, you have a better possibility
of detecting bugs.


Exercise 4: What is the pesticide paradox about and what does it imply to software testers?

The pesticide paradox refers to the technique of using the same tests over and over again in a
system. By doing this, the tests lose their effectiveness. This paradox implies that by no means 
is there a testing strategy that will allow you to find 100% of the bugs in a system. For every
method that you use to detect bugs, you will ultimately leave a trace amount of smaller bugs behind.


Exercise 5: Why should we automate, as much as possible, the test execution?

It is useful to automate the test execution because it saves software testers time.
This is because machines can go through a variety of steps much quicker than a human can, and 
this in turn provides quick feedback. As well as this, when test executions are automated, 
it can increase scoping of tests that improve the end result of the software quality. As well as this,
humans are prone to errors, by having test automation you will decrease the likelihood of small
errors in code.





PART 2 Smoke Testing (2%) Jpacman

Exercise 4:
Execute the smoke test, with coverage enabled. Name 2 classes that are not well-tested, and explain why the smoke test does not cover it.

==> Two classes that are not well tested are the CollisionInteractionMap class, and the LevelFactory class. 
The smoke test does not cover the CollisionInteractionMap class very well because nowhere in the smoker test does it test 
pacman colliding with any of the ghosts. This is what leads to the 0% methods and 0% lines covered.
The smoke test does not cover the LevelFactory class very well either for the reason that the smoker test doesnt include 
pacman having the ability to eat the ghost and actually consuming one. The situation of having to spawn/creat another ghost
is never introduced in the smoker test, which causes the coverage of the LevelFactory class to be poor.



Exercise 5:
Have a look at class game.Game, method move. Is it covered by oursmoke test?Now, comment out the line in that method, which is invoking the move method from the Level class. Run thesmoke test again. Explain the failure you see, and explain to what extent you think the resulting test failure canbe helpful in fixing the system.

==> Before commenting out the line, the Game class have good coverage, with and 85% methods and 90% lines coverage.
After commenting out the line in the method that invokes the moving method from the Level class,
the Smoke test fails and we are given the warning that we were expecting a value that we did not receive.
We can also notice that the coverage of the class has gone down by a substantial amount, proving that our smoke test could include more tests to provide more coverage in a case like this.


Exercise 6:
Exercise 6 (0.5%): Undo the previous change, but now change board.Direction.getDeltaX so that it returns dy instead of dx.
Next, undo the changes you made, and ensure all tests pass again. Explain what you see. Was it easy to understand where the problem is?

==> After changing the getDeltaX return value to dy, it was obvious that the test had failed, however, I had not noticed a difference
in the method coverage or the line coverage for the Direction class. So in that case it can be rather hard to locate where the problem is laying.
